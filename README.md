Horus 6.0 "cc 1.0"
==================

Horus is a php framework, but not a traditional framework, it is a micro and portable <br />
php framework that does most of operations in simple steps, no more configs, <br />
no more complex actions, no more complex files, no more comples structure, <br />
just define your own structure . <br />

Horus is just **1.8k** of lines in one file, organized and well commented, <br />
But Horus Light version is just "36 kb",<br />
just include **Horus.php** and start writing codes . <br />

Horus is micro framework just like **web.py** in python, or **sinatra** in ruby . <br />
