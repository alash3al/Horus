What is HPHP ?
=======
<p class="lead"><blockquote>
        HPHP is a minimal event-driven and flexible PHP web application framework that provides a powerful set of features for web based apps,
        creating a powerful API is quick and easy using its APIs, it is also focusing on scalability from small to large apps
        without killing PHP core features, it provides you with a very powerful <strong>Router</strong> in small number of lines
        with the support for subdomain routing in very easy way, you can also use its <strong>Events</strong> API to build
        any event-driven application and with the help of its <strong>Response</strong> manager you can have full control
        over the output easily, and with its <strong>Request</strong> manager you can take full control over the inputs
        it auto detects XML, Json or normal request input, there is more but all of that in just one organized file.
