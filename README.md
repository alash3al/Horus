What is Horus.php ?
=======
<p class="lead"><blockquote>
    HPHP is a minimal event-driven and flexible PHP web application framework that provides a powerful set of features for web based apps,
    creating a powerful API is quick and easy using its APIs, it is also focusing on scalability from small to large apps
    without killing PHP core features, it provides you with a very powerful <strong>Router</strong> in small number of lines
    with the support for subdomain routing in very easy way, you can also use its <strong>Hooks</strong> API to build
    any event-driven application and with the help of its <strong>Response</strong> manager you can have full control
    over the output easily, and with its <strong>Request</strong> manager you can take full control over the inputs
    it auto detects XML, Json or normal request input, you can also use its <strong>PDO</strong> simplified API, that merges PDO with PDOStatement in one object
    , there is more but all of that in just one file with ~1.4k of lines.
